The schema is in a file called, "Table Schema" (DDL) and queries in a seprate file called, "Queries" (DQL). The ERD is the "QuickDBD-Employee ERD.png". I also generated some code form the QuickDBDs that I used to write my Table Schema, which is included as "QuickDBD_ERD Schema". Lastly, because I ended up writing my DDL twice, once after I saw the generated code from QuickDBD, I included one where the keys and tables are created seperatley called "Seperated Tables and Keys".

I went over my ERD and defining a few keys with my tutor. From there, I worked on my queries solo, although we did go over some joins, which i used to refine my code.
